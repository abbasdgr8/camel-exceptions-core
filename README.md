# exceptions-core
A core set of Java exceptions and marker interfaces for use with Backend/Middleware systems.

It's recommended when you're handling exceptions in Backend/Middleware systems that you differentiate between recoverable and irrecoverable exceptions.  The classes provided here encapsulate this, and can be subclassed as required.

Examples of frequently-used subclasses which we have found useful can be found in the separate [exceptions-db](https://github.com/abbasdgr8/exceptions-db), and [exceptions-rest](https://github.com/abbasdgr8/exceptions-rest) projects.
